    "text": "Hello and welcome!\n\nI am Augustine and a graduate student pursuing MS in Quantitative Methods and Modeling at CUNY-Baruch College, New York with a strong interest in data-driven decision-making. My academic journey is built on a solid foundation in Economics. I have gained valuable experience as a Research Assistant in the past, where I honed my analytical and problem-solving skills.\nAs a budding Operations Research Analyst, I am eager to apply my knowledge in data analysis, quantitative modeling and optimization to solve real-world challenges. I am particularly interested in leveraging data science, machine learning and operations research techniques to drive insights in Manufacturing & Supply Chain, Energy & Utilities, Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals, Transportation & Logistics and Retail & E-Commerce.\nI am always looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects. If you’re interested in discussing ideas, sharing knowledge or working together, feel free to reach out!\n\n\nLast Updated: Saturday 02 08, 2025 at 18:44PM\n#| echo: false #| message: false #| warning: false\nif(!require(“leaflet”)){ options(repos=c(CRAN=“https://cloud.r-project.org”)) install.packages(“leaflet”) stopifnot(require(“leaflet”)) }\n\nBaruch College Coordinates\nbaruch_longitude &lt;- -73.98333 baruch_latitude &lt;- 40.75028\n\n\nCreate a leaflet map\nleaflet() |&gt; addTiles() |&gt; setView(baruch_longitude, baruch_latitude, zoom=17) |&gt; addPopup(baruch_longitude, baruch_latitude, “I am a Master’s student at Baruch College!”)"
