---
Hello and welcome! 

::: {.text-right}
I am **Augustine** and a graduate student pursuing **MS in Quantitative Methods and Modeling** at *CUNY-Baruch College, New York* with a strong interest in data-driven decision-making. My academic journey is built on a solid foundation in Economics. I have gained valuable experience as a Research Assistant in the past, where I honed my analytical and problem-solving skills. 

As a budding **Operations Research Analyst**, I am eager to apply my knowledge in *data analysis, quantitative modeling and optimization* to solve real-world challenges. I am particularly interested in leveraging data science, machine learning and operations research techniques to drive insights in *Manufacturing & Supply Chain, Energy & Utilities, Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals, Transportation & Logistics and Retail & E-Commerce*. 

I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects. If youâ€™re interested in discussing ideas, sharing knowledge or working together, feel free to reach out!
