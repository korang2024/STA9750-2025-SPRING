Hello and welcome!
I am a graduate student pursuing an MS in Quantitative Methods 
and Modeling at CUNY, Baruch College with a strong interest in data-driven 
decision-making. My academic journey is built on a solid foundation in Economics. 
I have gained valuable experience as a Research Assistant in the past, where I 
honed my analytical and problem-solving skills. 
As a budding Operations Research Analyst, I am eager to apply my knowledge in 
data analysis, quantitative modeling and optimization to solve real-world 
challenges. I am particularly interested in leveraging data science, machine 
learning and operations research techniques to drive insights in 
Manufacturing & Supply Chain, Energy & Utilities, Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals, 
Transportation & Logistics and Retail & E-Commerce.  
I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects. If youâ€™re 
interested in discussing ideas, sharing knowledge or working together, feel 
free to reach out!
